## Darts Score Tracking Web-app - Personal Project
Live Website: https://ericmong.herokuapp.com/

### Inspiration
As I own a competitve dartboard, unlike the electronic board you normally see in the bars, I have a hard time tracking my score whenever I'm playing or when I invite my friends over and play. Hence, I developed a simple web-app using ReactJS to keep track my score.

### Features
Currently, there is Standard Cricket, 301/501/701 Countdown. Hopefully I will be able to develop Cut-throat Cricket and also improve the UIUX of the overall web-app.
